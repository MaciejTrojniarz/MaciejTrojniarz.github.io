        <!--Role zespołowe wb.Belbin'a-->
        <div class="notes viewerNotes">Belbin suggests that, by understanding your role within a particular team, you can develop your strengths and manage your weaknesses as a team member, and so improve how you contribute to the team.<br>
            Team leaders and team development practitioners often use the Belbin model to help create more balanced teams.<br>
            Teams can become unbalanced if all team members have similar styles of behavior or team roles. If team members have similar weakness, the team as a whole may tend to have that weakness. If team members have similar team-work strengths, they may tend to compete (rather than cooperate) for the team tasks and responsibilities that best suit their natural styles.<br>
            Knowing this, you can use the model with your team to help ensure that necessary team roles are covered, and that potential behavioral tensions or weaknesses among the team member are addressed.</div>

            Their potential weaknesses may be that they're argumentative, and that they may offend people's feelings.</div>

        <div class="notes viewerNotes">If you manage an established team that has trust issues, it's essential to find out how these problems originate, so that you can come up with a strategy for overcoming them.<br>
            Consider giving team members a questionnaire to fill out anonymously. Ask them about the level of trust within the group, as well as why they think there's a lack of trust.
